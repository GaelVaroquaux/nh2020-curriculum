# Creating Python shareable Python libraries

The goal of this tutorial is to show you the way to make your code
more modular, more shareable and more robust.

## Not all code needs to be shareable

Not every analysis that you do on your data needs to be easy for others to use.
Ideally, if you want your work to be reproducible, it will be possible for others
to run your code. But this is not what we are talking about here. In the course of your work,
you will sometimes find that you are creating pieces of code that are useful
for you in more than one place, and may also be useful to others. For example,
collaborators in your lab, or other researchers in your field.
