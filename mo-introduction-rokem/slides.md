### The hacker ethos (based on Steven Levy's, *"Hackers"*)

* The hands-on imperative
* Sharing
* Information should be free
* Mistrust authority - promote decentralization
* ~~Meritocracy~~ Inclusivity
* You can create beautiful things with computers
* Computers can change your life for the better

### The era of brain observatories

Large-scale open datasets

  - Data-intensive methods
  - Open-source software
  - Team science

---

### Data-intensive methods

You're going to hear a lot about machine learning (and statistics)

But also:

- Data management
- Data visualization
- Workflows

---
## Open-source software

### Python

- Neuroimaging in Python

- Scipy / Pydata

- Python in industry

---
