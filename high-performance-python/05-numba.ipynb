    "### Numba does something quite different\n",
    "\n",
    "[Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) is a library that enables just-in-time (JIT)\n",
    "compiling of Python code. It uses the [LLVM](http://llvm.org/) tool chain to do\n",
    "this. Briefly, what LLVM does takes an intermediate representation of your code\n",
    "and compile that down to highly optimized machine code, as the code is running.\n",
    "That means that if you can get to this IR, you can get your code to run really\n",
    "fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numba is the bridge between the Python code and this intermediate\n",
    "representation. Along the way, it does some clever type inference (for example,\n",
    "if the code can take different types as input, integers vs. floats for example),\n",
    "which allows it to be even faster. And there is a bunch of additional\n",
    "cleverness. In particular, Numba is designed with scientific/numerical code in\n",
    "mind, so it can sometimes leverage the fact that you are using Numpy. But we\n",
    "won't get into that here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing\n",
    "\n",
    "Numba can be installed using `conda`:\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "conda install numba\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "{: .python}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Just-in-time compiling\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look again at the Fibonacci example we used before:\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "def fib(n):\n",
    "    a, b = 1, 1\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        a, b = a+b, a\n",
    "\n",
    "    return a\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "{: .python}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To get it to just-in-time compile on the first time it's run, we use Numba's\n",
    "`jit` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "from numba import jit\n",
    "fibj = jit(fib)\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "{: .python}\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing timings we see a roughly ten-fold speedup!\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to use `jit` is as a decorator:\n",

    "def fibj(n):\n",
    "    a, b = 1, 1\n",

    "> ## Python Decorators\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Decorators are a way to uniformly modify functions in a particular way. You\n",
    "> can think of them as functions that take functions as input and produce a\n",
    "> function as output (as explained on [this](http://matthew-brett.github.io/pydagogue/decorating_for_dummies.html) page by Matthew Brett).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> But the most concise explanation (as pointed out by MB) actually comes\n",
    "> from the [Python reference documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#function-definitions):\n",
    ">\n",
    "> A function definition may be wrapped by one or more\n",
    "> (*decorator*)[http://docs.python.org/glossary.html#term-decorator]\n",
    "> expressions. Decorator expressions are evaluated when the function is\n",
    "> defined, in the scope that contains the function definition. The result\n",
    "> must be a callable, which is invoked with the function object as the\n",
    "> only argument. The returned value is bound to the function name\n",
    "> instead of the function object. Multiple decorators are applied in\n",
    "> nested fashion. For example, the following code:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">    @f1(arg)\n",
    ">    @f2\n",
    ">    def func(): pass\n",
    ">\n",
    "> is equivalent to:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">    def func(): pass\n",
    ">    func = f1(arg)(f2(func))\n",
    ">\n",
    "> As pointed out there, they are not limited neccesarily to function\n",
    "> definitions, and [can also be used on class definitions](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#class-definitions).\n",

    "## How does Numba work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Do understand a little bit about how Numba works, let's see where it fails to\n",
    "work. Let's rewrite the `fib` function using a custom Python object:\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "class MyInt(object):\n",
    "  def __init__(self, n):\n",

    "    for i in range(n.int):\n",
    "        a.int, b.int = a.int+b.int, a.int\n",
    "\n",
    "    return a.int\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "{: .python}\n",
    "\n",
    "This looks odd, but it works in the same way that the function above does\n",
    "It's a bit slower, though (why do you think that is?).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's try to speed this up with Numba:\n",

    "{: .python}\n",
    "\n",
    "Timing this, we find it to be substantially *slower* than the non-jitted Python\n",
    "version. The reason for this is that Numba is unable to do any type inference\n",

    "\n",
    "### What is it really good for?\n",
    "\n",
