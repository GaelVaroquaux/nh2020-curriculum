# Optimization Models in Machine Learning: Introduction and Examples

This tutorial illustrates how many popular machine learning models can be formulated and solved through the lens of optimization. Through a combination of slides and exercises, we present intuition behind gradient descent, linear and logistic regression, regularization, and outlier detection.
