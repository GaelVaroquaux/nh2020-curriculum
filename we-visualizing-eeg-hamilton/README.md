# Neurohackademy 2020: Visualizing EEG with [`MNE-python`](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html)

**Author:** Liberty Hamilton

This repository contains material presented at Neurohackademy 2020 on visualization of invasive and noninvasive EEG data using MNE-python.

These notebooks can be run on [the Neurohackademy JupyterHub](hub.neurohackademy.org),
or directly in your local environment if you have [installed MNE-python according to these instructions](https://mne.tools/stable/install/index.html). I suggest running MNE in a conda environment to avoid any dependency issues that may come up.

If you have any questions, please open an issue or reach out to Liberty directly. Thank you!
